#9447B Temporary Worlds Notebook Repository

This is a private repository that I linked to our notebook using Gitfront. This will have all of our code in a format way easier to read than stuck in a notebook. 
If you would like to view the code, click on the folder with the code you want to see, click src, and click main.cpp! If you would like to see variables and functions for that code, instead of clicking in src, click on include, and click on functionsAndMotors.h! That will show you functions, motor definitions and variable definitions.
