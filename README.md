#9447B Temporary Worlds Notebook Repository

This is a private repository that I linked to our notebook using GitFront. This will have all of our code in a format way easier to read than stuck in a notebook. 
If you would like to view the code, click on the folder with the code you want to see, click src, and click main.cpp! If you would like to see variables and functions for that code, instead of clicking in src, click on include, and click on functionsAndMotors.h! That will show you functions, motor definitions and variable definitions. I have also posted my function library for past and present VEX games as well for reference. That can be found below the code folders. I'll be updating this, (as long as i can remember to do it alongside the private team github page) so if you decide to come back a week later (probably updating this on the weekend, so check on monday), there will be a good chance that I will have changed the code. This repository will not be updated after the conclusion of VEX Worlds 2021. 

My latest change: Added ProgramHub. A program with an auton selector interface and holds all of our needed autons. Finalized and tested them today - 5/10/21
